# Code Snippets by xythobuz

These are small code snippets, little helper libraries and other stuff I've written, as long as it does not qualify for an extra project.

## AvrSerialLibrary

Simple AVR UART Library for many different AVR types. I am using it in all of my AVR Projects.

## WinUnixSerial

C Library to speak to serial ports, cross plattform for Windows and Unix (only tested on Mac OS X). Can detect available ports. Used in the [LED-Cube](https://github.com/xythobuz/LED-Cube) PC Software [CubeControl](https://github.com/xythobuz/LED-Cube/tree/master/CubeControl)

## X11.c

Very simple C Program that shows a [X11](http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/) Window. Can be used as template for small X11 Projects.

## OpenGLTest

Simple [OpenGL GLUT API](http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/) template, ready to plug some logic in... :)

## RTLSDR

Some [Gnuradio](http://gnuradio.org) Scripts or Gnuradio-Companion files that work with [Realtek RTL2832U based DVB-T dongles](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) to use them as Software Defined Radio.

## githubhook.php

PHP Script that can be used as github post receive hook. Needs a MySQL Database. Can show commits in different repositories. E-Mail subscriptions for every repository can be created. This was useful in a time before automatic github E-Mails. [See it in action](http://www.xythobuz.org/cubehook.php)!

## Ameise.java

Little Java Utility that simulates Ant Behaviour. Essentially lights pixels with some simple rules.

## GoL.java

Improvement upon Ameise.java, this time implementing Conways Game of Life, visible in real-time.

## ProjectEuler

Solutions to some [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) Problems I did.

## dotfiles

I'm backing up my dotfiles in here.

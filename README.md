# Code Snippets by xythobuz

These are small code snippets, little helper libraries and other stuff I've written, as long as it does not qualify for an extra project.

## AvrSerialLibrary

Simple AVR UART Library for many different AVR types. I am using it in all my AVR Projects.

## WinUnixSerial

C Library to speak to serial ports, cross plattform for Windows and Unix (only tested on Mac OS X). Can detect available ports.

## X11.c

Very simple C Program that shows a X11 Window. Can be used as template for small X11 Projects.

## githubhook.php

PHP Script that can be used as github post receive hook. Needs a MySQL Database. Can show commits in different repositories. E-Mail subscriptions for every repository can be created. This was useful in a time before automatic github E-Mails.

## Ameise.java

Little Java Utility that simulates Ant Behaviour. Essentially lights pixels with some simple rules.

## GoL.java

Improvement upon Ameise.java, this time implementing Conways Game of Life, visible in real-time.

## dotfiles

I'm backing up my dotfiles in here. Also includes the handful of vim plugins I use.
